## Project Description
The idea behind the question „will my next phone be from space?“ was arised from my admiration regarding Elon Musk, (co-) founder of Paypal, Tesla, SpaceX and many more. His madness about establishing a human colony on Mars arouse my interest in space. But also the debate regarding the availability and sustainability of rare earth which is necessary for all this great technologies we are using, e.g. phones, TV-screens, solar panels and much more. 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions

1. Analyse the occurrence of rare earth in the world and if there are any associated conflicts

2. Is there any governmental effort for space mining?
